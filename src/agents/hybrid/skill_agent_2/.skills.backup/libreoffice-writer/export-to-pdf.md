## Export to PDF with options (preserve base filename)
1. Go to **File > Export As > Export as PDF…**.
2. In the file picker, set **File type** to **PDF - Portable Document Format (.pdf)**.
3. Keep the **Name** unchanged (Writer will add/keep the `.pdf` extension) and choose the destination folder.
4. Click **Save**.
5. In **PDF Options**, click **Export**.

## Fast export (no options)
- Use **File > Export Directly as PDF** (or the PDF toolbar button) to quickly create a PDF with default settings.

## If you’re unsure it worked
- Check the destination folder (e.g., **Desktop**) for a new `.pdf` with the same base filename.
