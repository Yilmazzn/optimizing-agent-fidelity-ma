## Format just one character (e.g., the “2” in H2O)
1. Place the caret **after** the target character.
2. Select only that character: **Shift+Left** (or Shift+Right).
3. Toggle:
   - **Subscript:** **Ctrl+Shift+B**
   - **Superscript:** **Ctrl+Shift+P**
4. Press an **arrow key** (or click elsewhere) to clear selection so subsequent typing isn’t sub/superscript.

## Menu fallback (reliable)
1. Select the text.
2. Go to **Format ▸ Character…**.
3. **Position** tab → **Subscript** / **Superscript** → **OK**.

Tip: With no selection, the shortcut toggles the mode for *future* typing—reselect the exact character(s) and retry.
