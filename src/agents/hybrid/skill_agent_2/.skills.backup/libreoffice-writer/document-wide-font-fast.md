## Quick way (direct formatting)
1. In the document body, press **Ctrl+A** (select all).
2. In the **Formatting** toolbar, click the **Font Name** box.
3. **Type** the font name (faster than scrolling), then press **Enter** to apply.

## Notes / gotchas
- This applies **direct formatting** to the current selection (good for “make everything one font” quickly).
- Headers/footers/footnotes may require placing the cursor in that area and repeating **Ctrl+A → Font Name → Enter**.
- If you want a style-driven solution (less brittle): **F11** → modify **Default Paragraph Style** (and any Character styles in use).
