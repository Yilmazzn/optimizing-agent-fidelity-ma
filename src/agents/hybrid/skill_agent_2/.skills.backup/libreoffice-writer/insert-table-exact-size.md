## Insert a table at the cursor (exact size, keyboard)
1. Place the text cursor where the table should be inserted.
2. Press **Ctrl+F12** to open **Insert Table** (dialog).
   - Menu fallback: **Insert ▸ Table…**
3. **Tab** to the **Columns** field, type the number of columns.
4. **Tab** to the **Rows** field, type the number of rows.
5. Activate **Insert** (usually **Enter** triggers the default button).

Use this instead of the grid picker when you need precise dimensions or when toolbar/menu access is finicky.
