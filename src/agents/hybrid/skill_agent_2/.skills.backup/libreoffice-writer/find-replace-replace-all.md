## Replace all (keyboard-driven)
1. Open **Find & Replace**: **Ctrl+H**.
2. Type the text in **Find**.
3. Press **Tab** to the **Replace** field and type the replacement.
4. Trigger **Replace All** without the mouse:
   - Press **Tab** until the **Replace All** button is focused, then press **Enter** (or **Space**).
   - If a direct shortcut works in your LO version (often **Ctrl+Alt+Enter**), you can use it, but prefer the focused-button method when unsure.
5. Save: **Ctrl+S**.
6. Close the dialog: **Esc**.

## Optional: limit scope
- To replace only within a selected block, select the text first, then **Ctrl+H** and enable **Current selection only** (label may vary) before running **Replace All**.
