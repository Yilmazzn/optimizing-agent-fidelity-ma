## Open file reliably (when the dialog feels unresponsive)
1. Open the picker: **File ▸ Open…** (or **Ctrl+O**).
2. In the dialog, **single-click** the target file, then **press Enter** *or* **double-click** the filename.
   - This is often more reliable than repeatedly clicking **Open**.
3. If the dialog doesn’t close immediately, **wait 5–10 seconds** (Writer may be busy loading the document).
4. If it still doesn’t proceed: click **Cancel**, then try again via **Ctrl+O**.

## Confirm which document actually opened
- If you have multiple Writer windows/documents: use **Window** menu to see/select the active document after the open action completes.
