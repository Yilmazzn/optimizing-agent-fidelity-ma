## Save an existing file under a new name/location
1. In Impress, press **Ctrl+Shift+S** (or **File ▸ Save As…**) to open the **Save As** dialog.
2. In the file picker, choose the destination from the left **Places** sidebar (e.g., **Desktop**).
   - If Desktop isn’t listed, go to **Home** and open the **Desktop** folder.
3. Click the **File name** field, press **Ctrl+A** to select the entire name, then type the new filename.
4. (If needed) pick the **Save as type / File format** (e.g., **PowerPoint (.pptx)**) rather than relying on just typing an extension.
5. Click **Save**.

### Overwrite prompt
- If the new name matches an existing file, Impress/your OS will prompt to **Replace/Overwrite**—confirm only if intended.
