## Generate a summary/agenda slide from existing slide titles
1. Open the presentation in **Impress**.
2. Go to **Slide > Summary Slide**.
3. A new slide is inserted containing a bullet list of the current **slide titles**.
4. (Optional) In the Slides pane, drag the summary slide to the desired position (e.g., after the title slide).
5. Edit the generated text as needed, then **Ctrl+S** to save.

Notes:
- Slides without a proper **Title** text may be omitted or appear blank in the summary list.
- If you just need to refresh the list after renaming slides, it’s often easiest to delete the old summary slide and run **Slide > Summary Slide** again.
