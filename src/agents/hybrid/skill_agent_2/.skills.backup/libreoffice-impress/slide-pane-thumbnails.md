## Restore/show the Slides pane (thumbnails)
1. Go to **View ▸ Slide Pane**.
2. Click it to toggle the thumbnails back on (checkmark = visible).

## Select slides without accidentally reordering
- In the **Slides pane**, **single-click** to switch slides; avoid click-drag unless you intend to move.
- Multi-select:
  - Range: **Shift+click** first/last thumbnail (or **Shift+↑/↓**)
  - Non-contiguous: **Ctrl+click** additional thumbnails

## Undo an accidental slide reorder
1. Press **Ctrl+Z** immediately (repeat if needed).

## Intentionally reorder slides (drag-and-drop)
1. Drag the thumbnail until you see the **insertion indicator line** between thumbnails.
2. Release to drop.

## Insert new slides quickly
- Select the slide **after which** the new slide should appear → press **Ctrl+M**.

## Duplicate one or many slides (in place)
1. Click inside the **Slides pane** so it has focus.
2. Select the thumbnails to copy.
3. Press **Ctrl+C**, then **Ctrl+V**.

Result: copies are inserted **immediately after the last selected slide**, preserving order.

Tip: To reach the end fast, press **Ctrl+End** before selecting.
