## Loop/repeat a slideshow (kiosk/multimedia)
1. Go to **Slide Show ▸ Slide Show Settings…**.
2. Enable **Loop and repeat after …** and set the delay.
3. (Optional) Uncheck **Change slides by clicking on background** to prevent mouse-click advance.
4. Start the show (**F5**) to verify it loops.

## Disable Presenter Console (single-screen slideshow)
If Impress opens a presenter view on one monitor and the audience slide on another:
1. Go to **Tools ▸ Options…**.
2. **LibreOffice Impress ▸ General**.
3. Under **Presentation**, uncheck **Enable Presenter Console**.
4. Click **OK**, then start the slideshow again (**F5**).

## Re-enable Presenter Console later
Repeat the same path and check **Enable Presenter Console**.
