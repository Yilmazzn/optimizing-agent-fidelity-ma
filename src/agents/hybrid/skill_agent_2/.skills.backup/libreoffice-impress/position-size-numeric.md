## Move an object to an exact spot (numeric X/Y)
1. Select the object (title/text box/shape) by clicking its **border** so resize handles show. If you see a text caret, press **Esc** to exit text-edit mode.
2. Open **View ▸ Sidebar** (if hidden).
3. Right Sidebar → **Properties** → expand **Position and Size**.
4. Under **Position**, edit **X** or **Y** (you can type units like `cm`).
   - **Y** increases downward (larger Y = lower on the slide).
5. Press **Enter** to commit the value (fields often don’t apply until Enter), then fine-tune as needed.

## If “Position and Size” isn’t visible
- The Properties deck is context-sensitive: re-click the object border (not the slide background) and re-open **Properties**.
