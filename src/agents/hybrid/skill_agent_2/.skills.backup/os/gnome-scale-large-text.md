Use when apps/UI are hard to read and one scaling method alone isn’t enough.

## Increase overall UI size (Display scaling)
1. Open **Settings** → **Displays**.
2. Under **Scale**, pick a larger value (e.g., **125% / 150% / 200%**).
3. Click **Apply**.
4. When prompted, confirm **Keep Changes** (or it will revert).

## Increase system text size (Accessibility “Large Text”)
1. Open **Settings** → **Accessibility**.
2. Turn on **Large Text**.

## Tuning heuristic
- Adjust **Scale** first (changes overall UI + layout), then fine-tune with **Large Text**.
- Combining a higher **Scale** with **Large Text** can improve readability when some apps don’t scale well with only one method.
