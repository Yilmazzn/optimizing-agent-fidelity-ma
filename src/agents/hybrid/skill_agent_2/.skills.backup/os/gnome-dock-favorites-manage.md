## Pin/unpin apps on the GNOME/Ubuntu Dock (Favorites)

### Unpin / remove an app from the Dock
1. In the left Dock, **right-click** the app’s icon.
2. Click **Remove from Favorites** (may appear as **Unpin** / **Remove from Dock**).

Note: this only removes the launcher; it does **not** uninstall the app.

### Pin an app to the Dock
1. Launch the app (so its icon appears in the Dock).
2. Right-click the Dock icon → **Add to Favorites**.

### Reorder pinned apps
- **Drag** Dock favorites up/down to change their order.

## Fast switching between pinned apps

### Mouse
- Click the other app’s Dock icon to focus it.

### Keyboard (most useful)
- Press **Super+1..9** to switch to/launch the corresponding Dock favorite (**1 = topmost**).

### Pitfalls
- If an app has multiple windows, repeated Dock clicks may cycle windows or show a window picker; use **Alt+`** to cycle windows within the current app.
- If you don’t want to rely on Dock order, use **Alt+Tab** instead.
