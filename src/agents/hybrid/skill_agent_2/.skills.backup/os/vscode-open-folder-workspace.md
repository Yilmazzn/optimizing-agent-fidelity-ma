## Open a folder as the workspace (GUI)
1. In VS Code (no folder open): use the **Welcome** tab → **Open Folder**.
   - Alternative: **File → Open Folder…**
2. In the system file picker, navigate to the parent directory.
3. **Single-click the target folder** so it’s highlighted.
4. Click **Open** / **Select Folder** to load it as the workspace.

## Keyboard shortcut (often faster)
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+K`, then `Ctrl+O`
- macOS: `Cmd+K`, then `Cmd+O`

## If you don’t want to replace the current workspace
- Use **File → Add Folder to Workspace…** instead of **Open Folder…**.
