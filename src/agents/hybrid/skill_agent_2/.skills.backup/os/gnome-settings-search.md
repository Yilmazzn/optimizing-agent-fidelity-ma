## Jump to a setting without knowing its sidebar category
1. Open **Settings** (press **Super**, type **Settings**, press **Enter**).
2. Click **Search** (magnifying glass) in the header **or** just start typing when the Settings window is focused.
3. Type a keyword (e.g., **dim**, **idle**, **power**, **display**, **scale**, **accessibility**, **large text**).
4. Click the matching result to open the exact Settings page/section.

Tip: This is more reliable than browsing the left sidebar because GNOME/Ubuntu versions move items between sections.

## Example: change Default Applications (Default Apps)
1. In **Settings**, use **Search** and type **Default Applications** (or **Default Apps**).
2. Open the result.
3. Use the dropdown for the category you care about (e.g., **Video** → **VLC media player**; also Browser/Mail/etc. depending on GNOME version).
4. Close Settings; changes apply immediately.
