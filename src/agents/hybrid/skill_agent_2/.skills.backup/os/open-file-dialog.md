## When “Open” / “Select Folder” does nothing in a file chooser
1. Navigate to the folder.
2. Single-click the intended **file or folder** so it’s highlighted/selected.
3. Click **Open** / **Select Folder** (or press **Enter** / double-click).

Many file choosers ignore the confirmation button until something is selected.
