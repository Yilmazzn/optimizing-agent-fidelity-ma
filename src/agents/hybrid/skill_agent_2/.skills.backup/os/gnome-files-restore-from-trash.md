## Restore deleted items (Ubuntu GNOME Files / Nautilus)
1. Open **Files** (Super → type “Files” → Enter).
2. In the left sidebar, open **Trash**.
3. Click the target item so it is **highlighted/selected** (multi-select if needed).
4. Click **Restore** in the top toolbar/header bar.
   - Alternative: right‑click the selection → **Restore**.

Restored items are returned to their original (last known) location.

## If “Restore” seems unresponsive
1. Re-check that an item is still **selected** (Trash easily loses focus/selection).
2. Try **Restore** again, or use **right‑click → Restore**.
3. Confirm success: the item **disappears from Trash**, then check its original folder.
