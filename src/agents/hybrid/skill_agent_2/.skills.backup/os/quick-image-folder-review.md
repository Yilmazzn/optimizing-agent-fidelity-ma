## Fast visual filtering of many images in one folder
1. In your file manager (e.g., Files), open **any** image in the target folder (double-click) to launch the default image viewer.
2. Use **Right Arrow / Left Arrow** to move to the **next/previous** image in that same folder (no need to close/reopen files).
3. When you find a keeper, capture its exact filename:
   - Often visible in the **window title bar**, or
   - Use the viewer’s **Info/Properties** panel/menu to show the filename.
4. When finished, close the viewer (**Alt+F4**) and copy/move the keeper files by name (or go back and multi-select them in the file manager).

**Tip:** Keepers are easier to track if you rename or star/tag them during review (if your viewer supports it).
