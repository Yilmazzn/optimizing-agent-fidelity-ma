## Recover when menu clicks don’t open dropdowns
1. Press **Esc** once (or twice) to exit **in-cell edit mode** and dismiss stray popups.
2. Focus the menu bar via keyboard:
   - Press **F10** (reliable), or
   - Press **Alt** (then the menu highlights).
3. Open the menu:
   - Use **Left/Right** arrows to pick a menu, then **Down** to open, or
   - Use the menu mnemonic (e.g., **Alt+F** for File) if available.
4. Use **Arrow keys** to navigate; **Enter** activates; **Esc** backs out.

Note: If **Alt** is intercepted by the desktop/window manager, prefer **F10**.
