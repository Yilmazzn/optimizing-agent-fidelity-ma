## Insert a sheet at a specific position (before/after an existing one)
1. In the sheet tabs bar, **right-click** the sheet you want to insert relative to (e.g., right-click **Sheet1** if you want the new sheet *before* it).
2. Click **Insert Sheet…**.
3. In the dialog:
   - Set **Position** to **Before current sheet** or **After current sheet** (wording may vary).
   - **Name**: enter one if required; otherwise leave it as-is and click **OK** to get the next default name (e.g., **Sheet2**, **Sheet3**).
4. Click **OK**.

Tip: The **+** button adds a sheet at the end; use **right-click > Insert Sheet…** when placement matters.

## Move/reorder a sheet tab precisely (avoid drag-and-drop mistakes)
1. **Right-click** the sheet tab you want to move.
2. Choose **Move or Copy Sheet…**.
3. In **Insert before**, select the **exact destination sheet** (the moved sheet will be placed immediately before it).
4. (Optional) Tick **Copy** if you want a duplicate instead of moving.
5. Click **OK**.

### If you must drag-and-drop
1. Make the destination area visible using the **tab bar scroll arrows** (left/right) so you can see the target tabs.
2. Drag the sheet tab **slowly**.
3. Watch for the small **triangle/insertion indicator** that shows where the tab will land.
4. Release only when the indicator is exactly at the desired position.
