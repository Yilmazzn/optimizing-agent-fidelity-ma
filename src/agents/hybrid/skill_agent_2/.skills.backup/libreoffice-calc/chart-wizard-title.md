## Set title during chart creation
1. Select your data range (include header row/column if you want labels).
2. Go to **Insert > Chart…**.
3. Step through **Chart Type**, **Data Range**, and **Data Series**.
4. On the final step **Chart Elements**, type your chart name into the **Title** field (and optionally **Subtitle**, **X axis title**, **Y axis title**) before clicking **Finish**.

**Note:** This is usually faster than creating the chart first and then editing the title via chart properties/edit mode.
