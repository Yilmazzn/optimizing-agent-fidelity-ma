## Save current webpage as a PDF (with margin control)
1. Open the page in Chrome, then press **Ctrl+P** (Print).
2. In the print preview sidebar, set **Destination** to **Save as PDF**.
3. Expand **More settings** (this is where layout controls are hidden).
4. Set **Margins** → **None** (or the margin preset you need).
5. Click **Save**.
6. In the system Save dialog, pick the target folder (e.g., **Desktop** in the left sidebar).
7. To keep Chrome’s default filename, **don’t edit the filename field**—just click **Save** to write the PDF.
