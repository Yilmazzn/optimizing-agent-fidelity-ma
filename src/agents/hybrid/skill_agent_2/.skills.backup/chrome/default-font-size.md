## Set Chrome-wide default font size (accessibility/readability)
1. Focus the address bar (**Ctrl+L**).
2. Open **`chrome://settings/fonts`**.
3. In **Customise fonts**, adjust **Font size** (slider) to the desired value (e.g., drag fully right to **Huge**).
4. Close the tab—changes apply immediately.

Note: This changes Chrome’s default rendering for most sites, but some pages can still override sizes via their own CSS.
