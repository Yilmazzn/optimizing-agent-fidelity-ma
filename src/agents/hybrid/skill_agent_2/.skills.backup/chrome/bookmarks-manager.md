## Toggle the Bookmarks bar (show/hide)
- Shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+B** (Windows/Linux) / **Cmd+Shift+B** (macOS)
- Menu: **⋮ > Bookmarks and lists > Show bookmarks bar**

## Bookmark the current page (choose exact folder)
1. Press **Ctrl+D** (Windows/Linux) / **Cmd+D** (macOS), or click the **★ (star)** in the address bar.
2. In the bookmark popup, open the **Folder** dropdown.
3. Pick the target folder (e.g., **Bookmarks bar** or a subfolder).
4. Click **Done**.

### Bookmark many pages into the same folder (fewer clicks)
- After you pick a folder once in the **Ctrl+D** popup, Chrome usually **remembers that folder** for subsequent bookmarks in the same session.
- For the next pages: press **Ctrl+D** → quickly verify the **Folder** field → click **Done**.

## Open Bookmarks Manager
- Shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+O** (Windows/Linux) / **Cmd+Option+B** (macOS)
- Or: **⋮ (Chrome menu) > Bookmarks and lists > Bookmark manager**
- Direct URL: `chrome://bookmarks`

## Create a folder in the Bookmarks bar (reliable alternative to right‑clicking the bar)
1. In Bookmarks Manager, click **Bookmarks bar** in the left sidebar.
2. Click the **⋮ (More)** menu (top-right).
3. Choose **Add new folder**.
4. Name it and click **Save**.

## Quick edits/moves (in Bookmarks Manager)
- **Drag and drop** bookmarks/folders to reorder or move between folders.
- **Right-click** a bookmark/folder to rename or delete (context menus are usually more reliable here than on the bar).
