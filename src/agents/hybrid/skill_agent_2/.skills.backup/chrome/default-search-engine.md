## Make an existing search engine (e.g., Bing) the default
1. Open `chrome://settings/search` (or Settings → **Search engine**).
2. Find **Search engine used in the address bar** and/or the **Search engines** list.
3. In the **Search engines** list, locate the engine (e.g., **Bing**).
4. Click the row’s **⋮** (three-dot) menu → **Make default**.
5. Verify **Search engine used in the address bar** now shows the desired engine.

## If the engine isn’t listed
Go to Settings → Search engine → **Manage search engines and site search** and add it under **Search engines** first, then use **⋮ → Make default**.
