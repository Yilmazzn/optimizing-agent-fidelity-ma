## Fast path in large Help Centers/KBs
1. Scan the site header/top navigation for a dedicated help topic that matches your issue (e.g., “Where’s My Ticket?”) and open it.
2. If the exact article isn’t visible, use the Help Center’s **internal** search box (often near the top or top-right of the page).
3. Search with the core keywords/phrase (e.g., `ticket delivery`).
4. Open the result that matches the canonical article title (often very close to your query, e.g., “Ticket Delivery Information”).

Notes:
- Prefer the KB’s internal search over clicking through categories when you already know what you’re looking for.
- Don’t confuse the site’s KB search with the Chrome omnibox; you typically need to type into the page’s own search field.
