## Rename current profile display name (Chrome)
1. Click the **profile avatar** icon at the top-right of Chrome (next to the address bar).
2. In the profile card/menu, click the **pencil / Edit** icon next to the profile name.
3. In **“Name your Chrome profile”** (or **Customize profile**), edit the **Name** field (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A → type new name) and press **Enter** (or click outside to save).

Notes:
- This changes the **local Chrome profile label** shown in the profile switcher, not your Google Account name.
