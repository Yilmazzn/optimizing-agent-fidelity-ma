Use this when you lose your place on a long/dynamic results page and need to quickly regain context.

1. Click an empty part of the page first (so keys don’t go to an input field).
2. Jump to the top: **Ctrl+Home** (Windows/Linux).
   - (Optional) Jump to bottom: **Ctrl+End**.
3. Move in controlled increments to the section you want:
   - **Page Down / Page Up** (or **Space / Shift+Space**).
4. If a cookie banner or modal blocks the page (esp. bottom area), dismiss it first (e.g., “Necessary only” / “Accept”) so scrolling/jumps reveal the content.
