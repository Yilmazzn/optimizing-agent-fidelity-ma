When a task asks for the *most replied/most active* thread on a forum-like site, you often don’t need search.

1. Go to the forum’s main topic list (category/home page where many threads are listed).
2. Look for an engagement metric shown per row (e.g., **Replies**, **Comments**, **Posts**, or **Views**)—often a numeric column or small badge next to the title.
3. If the column header is clickable, click **Replies/Comments** to sort descending (click again if it sorts ascending).
4. Otherwise, scroll/paginate and visually scan for the highest number.
5. Click the thread title with the highest count.

Notes:
- Watch for **Pinned/Sticky** threads; if the prompt implies “current” popularity, prefer non-pinned threads.
- If counts are split (e.g., “replies” and “views”), follow the prompt’s metric; if unclear, replies/comments usually indicate discussion activity.
