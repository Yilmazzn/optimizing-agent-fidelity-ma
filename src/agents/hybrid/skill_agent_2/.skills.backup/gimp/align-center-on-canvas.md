## Center one layer/object on the image
1. Select the layer you want to move in the **Layers** panel.
2. Choose **Tools → Transform Tools → Align**.
3. In **Tool Options**, set **Relative to: Image** (not “Selection” / “Active layer”).
4. On the canvas, **click the object/layer contents** to mark it as the align target (you should see the align handles/outline).
5. In Tool Options, click:
   - **Align center of target** (horizontal center)
   - **Align middle of target** (vertical center)

### Common pitfall
If nothing moves when you press the align buttons, you likely didn’t click the object on-canvas to set it as the Align tool’s target.
