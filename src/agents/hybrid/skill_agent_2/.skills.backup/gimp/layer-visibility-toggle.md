## Toggle layer visibility (show/hide)
- In the **Layers** dock, click in the narrow **visibility (eye) column** **left of** the layer thumbnail/name.
- Clicking the **layer row/thumbnail/name** selects the layer but **does not** toggle visibility.

## Make sure you’re editing the intended layer
1. Click the layer’s **thumbnail/name** to make it the **active** layer.
2. Confirm the active layer is the **highlighted** row in the Layers dock.
3. Run operations (e.g., **Layer > Scale Layer…**) only after the correct layer is active.

## Quick “isolate this layer” check
- Hide other layers via their **eye** icons, then ensure the target layer row is **highlighted** before editing.
