When a nested menu won’t expand reliably by mouse hover (tiny arrow hit-targets), use the keyboard once the parent row is highlighted.

## Open a submenu via keyboard
1. Open the top-level menu (e.g., **Layer**).
2. Click the menu row that has a submenu arrow (or use **Up/Down Arrow** to highlight it).
3. Press **Right Arrow** to expand its submenu.
4. Use **Up/Down Arrow** + **Enter**, or click the command.

Examples:
- **Layer > Transparency > Add Alpha Channel**
- **Image > Mode > Indexed…**

## Useful keys
- **Left Arrow**: go back to the parent menu
- **Esc**: close the menu
